		"description": "<p>Union for Street Solidarity is a group of socialists working to improve the immediate and long-term material conditions of the working poor and homeless in Salt Lake City. We believe that homelessness is a structural condition of capitalist society, not the result of the moral failing of any individual, and a problem which cannot be solved under capitalism. USS practices mutual aid through the distribution of free survival essentials while engaging in political action through collective struggle.</p><p>USS believes that people experiencing poverty and homelessness are the ones who should tell us what their needs are and how best to improve their circumstances. We conduct research through conversation and surveys, and use the information we gather to direct future political action and material aid.</p>"
